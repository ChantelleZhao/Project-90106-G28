The scripts for random forests and neural networks are available in folder: `Xinhui - SVM` and `nn_MLPClassifier_final.ipynb` for reuse for any additional dataset. 

The script for interpretation results is saved in `Interpretation using SHAP and LIME.ipynb`.

The prediction results for a list of open opportunities are in `open_prediction_results.csv` for the client's perusal.
